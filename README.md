#### I'm in my 3rd year of <mark>Neuroscience</mark> 🧠

#### I enrolled in this course because I have always been curious about coding in neuroscience and wanted to try something new :) 

#### The research aspect of neuroscience and learning about different mental health disorders and how it affects an individual is what got me interested in neuroscience.

#### Medicine or a masters in biomedical engineering
